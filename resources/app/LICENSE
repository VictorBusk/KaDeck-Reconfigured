3.1	With the subscription license for KaDeck Web, the User receives the time-limited, remunerated, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to install and use the Software as a cloud- and web-based service. The Software can be integrated into the User’s infrastructure, enabling multiple users to log-in and use the Software simultaneously.

This connection of the user account to the Software results in a data comparison to ensure copy protection. The information of the user account is stored exclusively on the XEOTEK server. The login information for KaDeck Web is solely stored on a database provided by the user.
3.3	The subscription license and the right to use the Software is limited to the term of one month from the purchase date.
